- 👋 Hi, I’m Samunta
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, C# and Javascript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning iterables in Python (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets etc)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects that allow me to evolve my skills (well, I think that's the reason every programming student come here on GitHub hahaha)
